# 🚀 REACT – Empowering Communities, Driving Change  

**REACT** is a **civic engagement platform** that transforms the way communities address problems and create solutions. It combines **AI-powered issue reporting (REACT)** with **community-driven action initiatives (ACT)**, ensuring that citizens are not just passive reporters but active problem-solvers.  

## 🔥 Why REACT?  
Too often, urban challenges like broken infrastructure, inefficient services, and lack of public support go unaddressed. **REACT** provides a seamless way to **report problems, mobilize solutions, and drive real impact**—all while ensuring transparency, accountability, and community collaboration.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18.17.1
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the variables if needed:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

### Development
Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Test Credentials
While the backend server is under maintenance, you can use these test credentials to access the app:

- **Email:** `test@react.com`
- **Password:** `test123`

These credentials will work even when the backend is offline, allowing you to test the app's frontend functionality.

**Note:** These are temporary test credentials and should not be used in production.
